We use a recent (>4.0.0) version of R with many packages in the tidyverse, most importantly ggplot2.

The ggsankey development package is installed from github.

We also tried out ggalluvial, but did not like it as much as the sankey graphs.

We use tidylog in some cases to make sure the transformations are doing what we hope they do. Commands that use this package are prepended with ~tidylog::.~
